# Beltza's very bad colorschemes

* Do you want to make your terminal look *awful*? Want to look different from all those scrubs using nord ~~(including myself)~~? Yes? Then this is the repo for YOUuu!!

* In this repository, you'll find colorschemes I made for myself and my friends! Most of the time, they're really really bad, but heyyyyy, maybe someone could like them so here you are!

* Feel free to use them as you please, etc. I'm not your father. (or am I????)
